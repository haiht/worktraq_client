        <p>Anvy Incâ€²s Worktraq OPM System enables you to create order and manage your promotional, marketing and POP purchases from the comfort of your office and save them for re order at a later date. Whether you are rebranding your current locations or opening new and exciting stores, our worktraq system allows your managers the freedom to order products and printed materials direct from our shop.  We create a simple database of products and prices, your managers and affiliates login into the system with proprietary usernames and select from a pre-selected list of items, the items are printed and shipped to the mangers location within five business days.  As a superuser, you have the ability to lock certain items from the ordering list or to allow managers and affiliates to order any item they need for their location.  We have the option to customize the database for the individual users and you will have the option to approve and review all orders before submitting to us.</p>
